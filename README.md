# weather_wind_power
Use Dash to plot produced wind power above maps of forecasts of wind speeds.

The requirements.txt file has not been cleaned up to include only strictly necessary packages yet. Also, it currently does not include the basemap package, which is required to run the code, but difficult to install. Hence the code is currently in progress of being migrated from relying on basemap to depending on functionality available in Dash natively.
